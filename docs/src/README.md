This is my implementation of the model behind RT-2. RT-2 leverages PALM-E as the backbone with a Vision encoder and language backbone where images are embedded and concatenated in the same space as the language embeddings. This architecture is quite easy to architect but suffers from a lack of deep understanding of both the unified multi modal representation or the individual modality representations.

## Installation

RT-2 can be easily installed using pip:

```bash
pip install rt2
```
# Usage


The `RT2` class is a PyTorch module that integrates the PALM-E model into the RT-2 class. Here are some examples of how to use it:

#### Initialization

First, you need to initialize the `RT2` class. You can do this by providing the necessary parameters to the constructor:

```python

import torch
from rt2.model import RT2

# img: (batch_size, 3, 256, 256)
# caption: (batch_size, 1024)
img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
caption = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))

# model: RT2
model = RT2()

# Run model on img and caption
output = model(img, caption)
print(output)  # (1, 1024, 20000)


```


## Benefits

RT-2 stands at the intersection of vision, language, and action, delivering unmatched capabilities and significant benefits for the world of robotics.

- Leveraging web-scale datasets and firsthand robotic data, RT-2 provides exceptional performance in understanding and translating visual and semantic cues into robotic control actions.
- RT-2's architecture is based on well-established models, offering a high chance of success in diverse applications.
- With clear installation instructions and well-documented examples, you can integrate RT-2 into your systems quickly.
- RT-2 simplifies the complexities of multi-domaster understanding, reducing the burden on your data processing and action prediction pipeline.

## Model Architecture

RT-2 integrates a high-capacity Vision-Language model (VLM), initially pre-trained on web-scale data, with robotics data from RT-2. The VLM uses images as input to generate a sequence of tokens representing natural language text. To adapt this for robotic control, RT-2 outputs actions represented as tokens in the modelâ€™s output.

RT-2 is fine-tuned using both web and robotics data. The resultant model interprets robot camera images and predicts direct actions for the robot to execute. In essence, it converts visual and language patterns into action-oriented instructions, a remarkable feat in the field of robotic control.

## Commercial Use Cases

The unique capabilities of RT-2 open up numerous commercial applications:

- **Automated Factories**: RT-2 can significantly enhance automation in factories by understanding and responding to complex visual and language cues.
- **Healthcare**: In robotic surgeries or patient care, RT-2 can assist in understanding and performing tasks based on both visual and verbal instructions.
- **Smart Homes**: Integration of RT-2 in smart home systems can lead to improved automation, understanding homeowner instructions in a much more nuanced manner.
