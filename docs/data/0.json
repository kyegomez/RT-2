This architecture is quite easy to architect but suffers from a lack of deep understanding of both the unified multi modal representation or the individual modality representations.\n[CLICK HERE FOR THE PAPER](https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/assets/rt2.pdf)\n## Installation\nRT-2 can be easily installed using pip:\n```bash\npip install rt2\n```\n# Usage\nThe `RT2` class is a PyTorch module that integrates the PALM-E model into the RT-2 class. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n#### Initialization\nFirst, you need to initialize the `RT2` class. You can do this by providing the necessary parameters to the constructor:\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom rt2.model import RT2\n# img: (batch_size, 3, 256, 256)\n# caption: (batch_size, 1024)\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)\ncaption = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))",
